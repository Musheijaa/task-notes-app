**Task Notes Manager**
Project Overview

The **Task Notes Manager** is a lightweight Flutter application built to help users organize their daily tasks and notes with ease.
It offers a simple yet efficient interface that allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks while keeping data stored locally using the **SQFLite** database.

The app includes a built-in theme toggle that lets users switch between light and dark modes. All preferences are saved locally, providing a consistent user experience each time the app is launched.

How It Works

* When the app starts, it initializes the **SQFLite** database to store tasks locally.
* Users can add new tasks through the **Add Task** screen.
* Tasks are displayed on the **Home Screen** with options to edit or delete.
* The selected theme mode (light or dark) is stored using **SharedPreferences**, ensuring it persists after closing the app.
